# Design System Tech Test

Welcome!

This exercise is designed to give us insight into how you approach **frontend development within the context of a design system**.
We're looking at how you think about:

- **Reusability** – can your component scale and be used consistently?
- **Theming** – does it adapt to light/dark modes and tokens via MUI theming?
- **Accessibility** – is it usable by keyboard, screen readers, etc.?
- **Developer Experience** – is the API clean, intuitive, and documented?
- **NPM packages** - can you package your newly created components into a NPM library so it can be consumed by other applications?

This starter repository contains a working **Storybook configuration** so you can easily develop your component in isolation and document its usage.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies using your preferred package manager
npm install
pnpm install
yarn install
bun install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Expected Time

Around 2 - 3 hours

## What are we looking for?

- Correct MUI theming
- Component API Design (props thoughtful, extensible and well-typed with TypeScript)
- Component reusability
- Documentation quality

## Background

You’ve recently joined a team working on a shared design system used across multiple applications.
A central requirement of this system is that all components must:

- Leverage the MUI API that developers are already familiar with
- Have a descriptive docstring using the [tsdoc format](https://tsdoc.org/) that contains relevant information for developers using the component
- Have a associated Storybook story demonstrating the different states of the component, see [`Button.stories.ts`](./src/stories/Button.stories.ts) for an example.
- Respond to light and dark mode changes automatically
- Handle various interactive states (hover, focus, pressed, disabled, loading) consistently
- Follow accessibility best practices (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, visible focus rings)
- Be theme-driven (no hardcoded colors, spacing, or radii), by leveraging the MUI themes configured in [`theme.ts`](./src/theme.ts).
- Leverage the MUI theme in [`theme.ts`](./src/theme.ts) to store reusable tokens, like colors or border radius
- Use the font Inter, by leveraging the [`@fontsource/inter` NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fontsource/inter)

### Task 1: Button

See [the "Buttons" Figma page](https://www.figma.com/design/wtMCijFeCt780z0fbtvBEP/Design-System-Tech-Test---Figma?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=qQKSXsPss7kiBGXZ-0) for mockups.

#### Requirements

- Must implement the following variants:
  - Contained
  - Outlined
- Must support the following states:
  - Default
  - Hover
  - Focus (keyboard‑visible, with accessible focus ring)
  - Disabled
- Must use theme tokens from [`theme.ts`](./src/theme.ts)
- Must support light and dark mode
- Must include a TSDoc comment block (with description, props, usage notes).
- Add a Storybook story showing each state.

#### Evaluation

- Correct MUI theming usage
- Clean and extensible API design
- Accessibility (focus ring, screen reader support)
- Documentation (TSDoc + Storybook)

### Task 2: Text Field

See [the "Text Field" Figma page](https://www.figma.com/design/wtMCijFeCt780z0fbtvBEP/Design-System-Tech-Test---Figma?node-id=1-181&p=f&t=qQKSXsPss7kiBGXZ-0) for mockups.

#### Requirements

- Must support the following variants:
  - Empty
  - Placeholder
  - Filled
- Must support the following states:
  - Default
  - Hover
  - Focused
  - Error
  - Disabled
- Must use tokens from [`theme.ts`](./src/theme.ts).
- Must include TSDoc documentation for props and usage.
- Add a Storybook story showing states.

#### Evaluation

- Correct component composition
- Theme integration
- Clear, typed props API
- Accessibility (label → input associations, error handling)
- Documentation (TSDoc + Storybook)

### Task 3: Deploy the Storybook documentation

Publishing Storybook ensures the design system is shareable across teams as **living documentation**.
This makes it easy for designers, engineers, and stakeholders to browse components without running code locally.

This project is already setup with a `build-storybook` command for building it as a static site.

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

Once built, the static content is available in the `storybook-static` directory.

Next we want deploy the static content so its publicly available. You may use your preferred hosting service, some easy to use ones include:

- GitHub Pages
- Vercel
- Netlify

The Storybook docs has an example for [deploying to GitHub Pages](https://storybook.js.org/docs/sharing/publish-storybook#github-pages).

#### Evaluation

- Storybook successfully deployed and accessible online
- Link provided in README

### Task 4: Export the components as a reusable NPM package

Next we want to make our Design System consumable in other projects, for this we are going to create a reusable NPM package.

The [NPM documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules) contains some useful background for how these packages work.

#### Requirements

- Setup a build step (`npm run build`) that outputs compiled code into a `dist` directory.
  - We only need to support ESM
  - TypeScript typings should also be generated
- Export components via an `index.ts` barrel file:
  ```ts
  import { PrimaryButton, TextFieldWithLabel } from "design-system-tech-test";
  ```
- Test locally using:

  ```bash
  cd ~/Projects/design-system-tech-test   # Go to where you keep this repo
  npm link                                # Create a global link

  cd ~/Projects/test-app                  # Go to another React app
  npm link design-system-tech-test        # Link the design system package
  ```

- Add Installation instructions to the `README.md`:
  - This should contain some brief instructions so a developer can setup the design system in their own project.
  - Assume that the infrastructure is already in place to publish the package to a NPM registry and the user just needs to `npm install design-system-tech-test`

#### Evaluation

- Package builds successfully into the `dist` directory
- Components work when linked locally, for testing we will use the `react-ts` Vite template [mentioned here](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).
- Clear, developer-friendly documentation

## 📘 Design System Documentation

The full hosted documentation for this Design System is available here:

**https://vvsrrsunny.github.io/design-system-tech-test-main**

# Design System, Local Development, and Consumption Guide

This document explains how to build, link, and consume the `design-system-tech-test` package in another React application.

---

## 1. Setup and Build the Design System

Inside the `design-system-tech-test` project:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

This compiles the library into `/dist` and exposes it globally for local linking.

---

## 2. Create or Prepare a Consumer App

You can use any React app, but Vite + React + TypeScript is recommended.

### Create a new consumer app

```bash
npm create vite@latest <consumer-app-name> -- --template react-ts
cd <consumer-app-name>
npm install
```

Or use your existing React app.

---

## 3. Install Required Dependencies

Your Design System requires these dependencies in the consumer project:

- **React / ReactDOM:** any `19.x.x` version (e.g. `19.0.0`, `19.0.1`, `19.1.0`, …)
- **@mui/material:** version `7.3.2` (or a compatible `7.3.x` if you choose to relax it)
- **@emotion/react:** any `11.14.x` or higher `<12.0.0`
- **@emotion/styled:** any `11.14.x` or higher `<12.0.0`

---

## 4. Add Vite Dedupe Configuration (Important)

Update `vite.config.ts` to ensure shared React + Emotion instances:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    dedupe: ["react", "react-dom", "@emotion/react", "@emotion/styled"],
  },
});
```

---

## 5. Link the Design System Package

Inside the consumer app:

```bash
npm link design-system-tech-test
```

This links your local build instead of downloading from npm.

---

## 6. Import DS Styles

If your Design System outputs CSS, import it inside your entry file:

```ts
import "design-system-tech-test/dist/design-system-tech-test.css";
```

---

## 7. Using the Design System

Wrap your app with the DS `ThemeProvider` and use components normally.

Example:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider, Button } from "design-system-tech-test";

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Button label="Click Me" />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- The default theme is **light**
- All DS components should be wrapped in `ThemeProvider`

---

## 8. Run the Consumer App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or build:

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## Done!
